Task: Develop a Fast, Free, and Unlimited Image Type Conversion Tool

Objective:
Create an intuitive, user-appealing online tool for converting between various image formats quickly and efficiently, with no limitations on usage.

Key Features:

Image Conversion:
Supported Formats: 
Input: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, SVG, WebP
Output: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP
Batch Conversion: Allow users to convert multiple images at once.
User Interface (UI):
Drag and Drop: Implement an easy drag-and-drop interface for uploading images.
Responsive Design: Ensure the tool looks and functions well on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Real-time Preview: Show a preview of the converted image before final download.
Progress Indicators: Display progress bars for uploads and conversions.
Performance:
Speed: Optimize for fast conversion times, especially for bulk operations.
Server-side Processing: Handle conversions on the server to not overload client machines.
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to speed up repeat conversions.
Interactivity:
Customization Options: 
Quality settings for output (e.g., compression levels for JPEG).
Resize options before conversion.
Option to change image dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
Interactive Elements: 
Tooltips for each conversion option explaining what it does.
Animated feedback for actions like successful upload or conversion.
Usability:
No Sign-Up Needed: Allow users to use the tool without registration.
Download Management: Offer choices for download (single file, zip for multiple files).
Error Handling: Clear, user-friendly error messages for incorrect inputs or conversion issues.
Accessibility:
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all functionalities are accessible via keyboard for better usability.
Screen Reader Compatibility: Design with screen readers in mind to aid visually impaired users.
Security:
Image Privacy: Ensure images are deleted from the server after conversion or upon user logout.
No Tracking: Avoid using cookies or tracking unless necessary for functionality.
Legal and Compliance:
Terms of Use: Clearly state terms regarding usage limits, if any, and data handling.
Privacy Policy: Include a policy explaining how images are handled.

Technical Requirements:
Backend: Use a scalable server-side language like Node.js, Python, or Go for image processing.
Frontend: Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular) for dynamic UI.
Image Processing Libraries: Consider libraries like Sharp for Node.js, Pillow for Python.
Deployment: Consider cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for deployment.

Timeline: 
Phase 1 (2 weeks): Wireframe and initial UI design, backend setup for basic conversion.
Phase 2 (3 weeks): Implement all features, user testing, and optimization.
Phase 3 (1 week): Final testing, bug fixes, and deployment.

Deliverables:
Fully functional, deployed web application.
Documentation for users on how to use the tool.
Developer documentation for future maintenance or enhancements.

Notes:
Prioritize user experience in design and functionality.
Ensure the tool remains free and unlimited for public use.
